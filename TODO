gtk3-nocsd TODO
---------------

 - Investigate whether we should force gtk-dialogs-use-header to FALSE
   (the current default in non-GNOME environments) or not.

 - Hide header bar if it were to contain only the title.

 - Split source code into multiple files.

 - Use same code paths for all Gtk versions, remove compositing hack
   completely.

 - Potentially add support to selectively enable gtk3-nocsd only for
   specific applications. (How?)
